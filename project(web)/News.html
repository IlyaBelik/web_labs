                        <h3>Cleveland Cavaliers fire Tyronn Lue, elevate Larry Drew to interim head coach</h3>
                        <p>CLEVELAND – Cavaliers Head Coach Tyronn Lue was released today by the team. Associate Head Coach Larry Drew has been named interim head coach. The announcement was made from Cleveland Clinic Courts by Cavaliers General Manager Koby Altman. 

“This was a very difficult decision. It is especially so, considering Coach Lue’s time with us over the last four years, including four straight trips to the NBA Finals,” said Altman. “We have respect and great admiration for Ty, not only as a coach, but a person. We thank him for the many ways he has contributed to our success, wish him the best and he will always be remembered for leading a very special Cavs team back against the odds to win the title in 2016. This is a different team equation, though, and one that we felt needed a different voice and approach that required this change.”

                        <h3>Klay Thompson breaks Stephen Curry's record for 3s in game</h3>
                        <p>CHICAGO (AP)  -- Klay Thompson has broken teammate Stephen Curry's NBA record for 3-pointers in a game with his 14th during a brilliant offensive performance by the Golden State Warriors.

Thompson set the mark with just under five minutes remaining in the third quarter Monday night against the Chicago Bulls. He was mobbed by teammates as the players headed to the sideline for a timeout, with the Warriors leading 113-69.

Golden State led 92-50 at halftime, the second highest point total for a half in NBA history. Phoenix scored 107 points in the first half of a 173-143 victory over Denver in 1990.
Thompson was just 5 for 36 from long range through Golden State's first seven games.

Curry hit 13 3-pointers against New Orleans on Nov. 11, 2016.</p>

                        <h3>Pelicans' Anthony Davis misses second straight game with sprained elbow</h3>
                        <p>DENVER (AP) -- New Orleans Pelicans forward Anthony Davis was held out for a second straight game because of a sprained right elbow.

Coach Alvin Gentry said Monday night before the game against the Denver Nuggets that while Davis still experienced some pain, the injury wasn't considered "any big deal." Gentry added that it's early in the season and the team doesn't want to take any chances.

Davis also sat out Saturday's loss to Utah. He's averaging 27.3 points, 13.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists for New Orleans this season.

In addition, the Pelicans were without guard Elfrid Payton because of a sprained right ankle. Payton is averaging 11.6 points and 6.4 assists.
